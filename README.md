# booking application

This is a CLI ticket booking application, developed in golang. I worked on this while learning golang.

## Guide to installing it in your local system

- You should make sure whether you have go installed in your system or not. This can be confirmed using the following command:

```
$ go version
```

If not installed go, head over to [Go install docs](https://golang.org/doc/install).

- Else, clone this repo by using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/shikharcodes/booking-application.git
```

- To start the cli-application, change the directory to `booking-app` by:

```
cd booking-app
```

- Now, run the following command to execute the app:

```
$ go run .
```
